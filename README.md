# RPI_home_theater
Code for Raspberry pi use as a home theater.

##Ideas
- boot up on start and is a file on the home screen
- 3d print case and attach it to ceiling
- get wireless mouse and keyboard.
- maybe add light controls to it?


Make big window buttons to fill up the screen of:
- amazon prime
- netflix
- hulu
- youtube
- sonos
- ...  media

maybe see if you can go xbox? idk how possible that is.  actually if i have a wireless hdmi switcher it might just work through the wires and gpio then computer to use as pc

search bar to look for a specific title ie: firestick

use pictures and icons to make it look nicer
