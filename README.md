# RPI_home_theater
Code for Raspberry pi use as a home theater.

## Ideas
- boot up on start and is a file on the home screen
- 3d print case and attach it to ceiling
- get wireless mouse and keyboard.
- maybe add light controls to it?
- use pypy3 it compiles so startup will be slow but runtime will be good!  especially useful if i dont use it as a computer

- amazon prime
- netflix
- youtube

for xbox/ wii use an hdmi switcher, break apart and then attach wires to the leads and buttons.  Use arduino/ arduino nano to control the switcher.  The cycle breakdown and flow chart is in the code
